He has developed an interest in language, aviation, cars, philosophy, travel, and of course, hiking. He has enjoyed time in many countries, he has learned German, how to fly an airplane, and how to drive a car calmly in traffic. Zack is currently building an app for a cooking game.</p>

He occupies his time by coding, writing and drawing. He spends too much time reading and dreaming about making video games yet rarely plays them. An armchair historian and carpenter, he's always down for a good heated debate or demolition day.</p>
